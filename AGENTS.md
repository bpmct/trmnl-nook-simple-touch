# Agent notes (legacy Android / NOOK Simple Touch)

This repo targets very old Android and an Eclipse ADT / Ant-era workflow.
Do not suggest modern Android tooling or APIs unless they are explicitly
compatible with Android 2.1 (API 7).

Current notes:
- Main entry activity: `DisplayActivity`.
- API credentials/base URL live in app settings (`ApiPrefs`).

## Worktree Setup

After creating a new worktree, run `./tools/setup-worktree.sh` to symlink
`local.properties` and the SpongyCastle JARs from the main repo.
